        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>Hi, I'm Anthony O'Connor. I'm a full stack software developer living in Vancouver.</p>
        <p>I write code, delete code, write more code, lead development teams and work with business teams.</p>
        <p>Feel free to
            <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
        <h3>About this site</h3>
        <p>You might have noticed that the site is pretty bare bones. I only set it up as an exercise to go through the full
            process of getting a domain, hosting it on Azure and setting up an ssl cert using
            <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt.</a> I work on sites for large companies who usually hve their own operations teams and therefore
            I never have to be involved in things like setting up ssl certs or buying domains.
        </p>
        <p>The site is also as stripped down as it can be. A few lines of css and mainly text. It's less than 50KB and most of that
            is google analytics, just in case anyone ever visits the site other than me. So at least it won't eat into your
            data plan.
        </p>
