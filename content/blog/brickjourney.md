Lately I've been making some stop motion brickfilms with my son. I've also been taking the time to do some photography again. Mixing the two I've created another site, <a href="https://brickjourney.anthonyoconnor.ca/">Brick Journey</a> to show what I've been doing.

We are just starting out making brickfilms. This website is to show the progress we make as we explore this new medium.
