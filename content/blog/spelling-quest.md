To help our kids with learning to spell I created a Wordle type game called <a href="https://spellingquest.com/">Spelling Quest</a>.
You play a word and then try to spell it. You get feedback like in Wordle based on which characters are in the correct places.
Words are in groups such as 'days of the week', animals, etc.
