## A company focused on making Alexa Skills.

 Recently I started exploring the world of <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit" target="_blank">Alexa Skills</a>. It's been a fun experience  about Alexa and how the whole system works.

I wanted to go through the whole process of creating a Skill as well as actually launching it to the Amazon store. To that end I created a simple game for my kids to get them up and jumping around. They think it's great fun.

I decided that rather than publishing the Skill under my own name I'd setup a company to publish under. I'm planning on exploring this space a bit more to see where I can take it.

So today I launched <a href="https://digitallyuncommon.com/" target="_blank">digitallyuncommon.com</a>. This company will be focused on Alexa Skills for now. My first Alexa Skill is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digitally-Uncommon-Lets-get-moving/dp/B07KYCYPNM" target="_blank">Let's get moving</a>. Check it out and let me know what you think.</p>
